I re-used the Material Design 3 Sample app to show how one can get device frame shots of your flutter app screens. And then you can use your desktop system OS print system to get fast contact sheet proof sheets.

Copy, fork, and modify for fun and profit. And, yes that proof app should be used to work out your flutter app theme!
